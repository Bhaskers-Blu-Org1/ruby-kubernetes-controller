# Ruby Kubernetes Controller

Current Build: [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/IBM/ruby-kubernetes-controller.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/IBM/ruby-kubernetes-controller)

`Ruby Kubernetes Controller` is a Client-Side library which allows users to 
interact with core Kubernetes APIs natively from within their 
Ruby applications. This library is compatible with all leading Kubernetes 
Instances, including OpenShift Kubernetes, Azure Kubernetes Service, 
Amazon EKS, Google Kubernetes Service, IBM Kubernetes Service, and Rancher 
Orchestrated Kubernetes. This library also supports yaml ingestion 
for creating, patching, updating, or deleting existing Kubernetes 
types, including Pods, Services, Deployments, Endpoints, and Ingresses. 
Our documentation also contains complete examples for all operation types.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ruby-kubernetes-controller'
